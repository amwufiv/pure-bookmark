# Icons

This folder should contain the extension icons:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for browser UI)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

You can create simple bookmark-themed icons or use any design you prefer.

## Quick Generation

You can use any of these methods:
1. Use an online icon generator
2. Create SVG icons and export to PNG
3. Use design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Photoshop

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple colored squares as temporary icons.
